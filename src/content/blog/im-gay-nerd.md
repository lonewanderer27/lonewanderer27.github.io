I've recently watched Netflix's Heartstopper and I just related so much to Charlie. There's never been an instance that a character in a movie or series, that made me feel so seen as a person.
Charlie is someone is who is very introverted, and good at math (while I am skilled at programming and I also like computers), minus the part that he is good at music because for the life of me I can't even read music notes.

Coming out today was probably late since I've already known myself as gay years years ago, but I'm just the type of gay guy who is very discreet, and I just thought that nothing is gonna change even if I come out.

But I just really wanna get this out of my chest. There is still part of me that wants to be seen as the real me. I tried to keep it to my immediate family and select relatives only and a very few close friends but I feel like in this time I shouldn't be scared anything anymore. This is me and if somebody can't accept me so be it.

So here ya go ya'll, I'm part of the rainbow 🙂 🏳️‍🌈 ❤️
