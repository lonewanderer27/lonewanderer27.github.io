### Introduction

My name is Jay, and I am a Front End Web Developer with a year of hands-on experience in designing, developing, and implementing web applications and solutions. I am passionate about creating highly interactive web applications with responsive design that look good on every user's device. As a student-leader and people-oriented worker, I excel in fostering collaborative environments and driving team success.

### Professional Life

My journey into web development commenced during my tenure as a sophomore at Adamson University, where I undertook my initial web project at an agency. Tasked with crafting the inaugural website for ABC-RMO Security, I collaborated with my colleague, [SwiftNCloak](https://github.com/SwiftNCloak), a skilled UI/UX developer.

The agency, being a security agency, emphasized the importance of a robust online presence for ABC-RMO Security. In addition to website development, I spearheaded the acquisition of a domain and establishment of hosting services, essential for bolstering the company's digital footprint. Furthermore, I facilitated the setup of the company's email system, elevating their professional image by transitioning from generic email services to a domain-specific email platform.

Given a tight timeframe, I diligently immersed myself in learning PHP and WordPress-specific APIs within a month's time, ensuring proficiency to execute the project seamlessly.

Impressed by our work, ABC-RMO Security further entrusted me with the development of their sister company's website, OMP Security. Here, I revamped the design of the initial website, infusing modern aesthetics and introducing a dedicated section for prospective security personnel to submit job applications. Both projects were constructed using WordPress, requiring proficiency in PHP and WordPress-specific APIs.

### Education and Skills Development

My journey into programming began during my freshman year at Adamson University under the tutelage of Sir Rico, where I delved into the realms of C#. Subsequently, during a two-month hiatus, I undertook the "100 Days of Code" Python course by Angela Yu. Although I paused at the 30th day, where I gained proficiency in developing Python servers with Flask, this experience ignited my passion for crafting interactive web applications with Python as the API server.

Building upon this foundation, I augmented my skill set by enrolling in a React course on Scrimba, further honing my front-end development abilities. This skill acquisition facilitated my transition into a part-time role as a Front-End Web Developer, where I collaborated with a team utilizing Laravel as the API server alongside React in the development of an Airbnb-style website. 

### Personal Growth and Outlook

My inclination towards problem-solving and perpetual learning fuels my enthusiasm for software development. As a student-leader and people-oriented worker, I am adept at fostering collaborative environments and leveraging diverse perspectives to drive innovation and achieve collective goals. I am captivated by the dynamic nature of the JavaScript ecosystem and am committed to staying abreast of emerging technologies and frameworks to continually enhance my skill set.

In the ensuing years, I aspire to amalgamate the insights garnered from professional engagements and personal projects to evolve into a proficient full-stack developer, equipped to tackle multifaceted challenges in the digital landscape.
