Hi I'm Jay, a Front End Web Developer with a year of hands-on experience designing, developing and implementing web applications and solutions. 

I am passionate in creating highly interactive web applications with responsive design that look good on every user's device. When assigned to a task, I make sure that it is efficiently done and passed ahead of the deadline.

#### Professional Life

I've gotten my first web project while I was a sophomore in Adamson University. I worked as a web developer in an agency as a web developer to make their first website, along with my friend [SwiftNCloak](https://github.com/SwiftNCloak), who’s a front-end developer.

I've learned a lot in making a website that uses a Content Management System like WordPress. And since it is their first website, it needed a custom domain that they can use for email and website, so I've also had an opportunity to learn the web hosting so I can set it up for them. The project was successful and we're paid well for the job. 

#### History

Programming was something I didn’t really knew when I was a kid, although I am very interested in figuring how things work. I remember my dad used to ridicule me because I would disassemble my toys to know how how they work, and then later on I’d have a broken toy because I don’t know how to assemble it back.

My journey to becoming a software developer really started when I started my freshman year in Adamson where I learned C# in Sir. Rico’s Computer Programming class. Since then I’ve been working on several side-projects in my free time that made me a better programmer. I’ve really enjoyed problem solving, searching in the documentation for answers to make my program work.

#### Outlook

Someone said that in every second, a new Javascript framework is born, and that is what makes the Javascript ecosystem exciting for me. 

Right now I'm focusing on learning the different libraries that React to improve my front-end dev skills. In the following years, I plan to integrate what I learned so far from working professionally and making my side-projects to transition to being a full-stack developer.
