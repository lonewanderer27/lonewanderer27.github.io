Hi I'm Jay and I'm a Front End Web Developer with a year of hands-on experience designing, developing and implementing web applications and solutions. Seeking to leverage a broader development experience and hands-on technical expertise in a front-end web development role.

I started out as a backend developer, specializing in making API route endpoints using Flask and Django. I always keep in mind to keep the API Endpoints that I make really fast, but also has an easy to use and concise API, along with proper documentation.

Then I moved to front-end development by making fully interactive web applications using React, while also leveraging my experience with designing backend API routes to build a series of full-stack web applications.   

#### Professional Life

I've gotten my first web project while I was a sophomore in Adamson University. I worked as a web developer in an agency as a web developer to make their first website, along with my friend [SwiftNCloak](https://github.com/SwiftNCloak), who’s a front-end developer.

I've learned a lot in making a website that uses a Content Management System like WordPress. And since it is their first website, it needed a custom domain that they can use for email and website, so I've also had an opportunity to learn the web hosting so I can set it up for them. The project was successful and we're paid well for the job. 

#### History

Programming was something I didn’t really knew when I was a kid, although I am very interested in figuring how things work. I remember my dad used to ridicule me because I would disassemble my toys to know how how they work, and then later on I’d have a broken toy because I don’t know how to assemble it back.

My journey to becoming a software developer really started when I started my freshman year in Adamson where I learned C# in Sir. Rico’s Computer Programming class. Since then I’ve been working on several side-projects in my free time that made me a better programmer. I’ve really enjoyed problem solving, searching in the documentation for answers to make my program work.

#### Outlook

Someone said that in every second, a new Javascript framework is born, and I think that is what makes the Javascript ecosystem exciting. Right now I'm focusing on learning the different libraries that React to improve my front-end dev skills. In the following years, I plan to integrate what I learned so far from working professionally and making my side-projects to transition to a full-stack dev.
