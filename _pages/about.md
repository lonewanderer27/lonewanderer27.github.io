### Introduction

My name is Jay and I am a Front End Web Developer with a year of hands-on experience designing, developing, and implementing web applications and solutions. I am passionate about creating highly interactive web applications with responsive design that look good on every user's device. When assigned to a task, I make sure that it is efficiently done and passed ahead of the deadline.

### Professional Life

I got my first web project while I was a sophomore in Adamson University. I worked as a web developer in an agency to make their first website, along with my friend [SwiftNCloak](https://github.com/SwiftNCloak), who is a front-end developer.

I learned a lot in making a website that uses a Content Management System like WordPress. And since it was their first website, it needed a custom domain that they can use for email and website, so I also had an opportunity to learn web hosting so I could set it up for them. The project was successful and we were paid well for the job.

### History

Programming was something I didn't really know when I was a kid, although I was very interested in figuring out how things work. I remember my dad used to ridicule me because I would disassemble my toys to know how they work, and then later on I'd have a broken toy because I didn't know how to assemble it back.

My journey to becoming a software developer really started when I began my freshman year in Adamson where I learned C# in Sir. Rico's Computer Programming class. Since then, I've been working on several side-projects in my free time that made me a better programmer. I've really enjoyed problem-solving, searching in the documentation for answers to make my program work.

### Outlook

Someone said that in every second, a new Javascript framework is born, and that is what makes the Javascript ecosystem exciting for me.

Right now, I'm focusing on learning the different libraries that React offers to improve my front-end dev skills. In the following years, I plan to integrate what I've learned so far from working professionally and making my side-projects to transition to being a full-stack developer.
