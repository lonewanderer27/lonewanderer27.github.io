I turn half cup of coffee :coffee: into code, use *Nix as my daily driver OS and aspires to be a Software Engineer someday.

Hi I'm Jay and I'm a Front End Web Developer with a year of hands-on experience designing, developing and implementing web applications and solutions. Seeking to leverage a broader development experience and hands-on technical expertise in a front-end web development role.

I started out as a backend developer, specializing in making API route endpoints using Flask and Django. I always keep in mind to keep the API Endpoints that I make really fast, but also has an easy to use and concise API, along with proper documentation.

Then I started doing front-end development by making fully interactive web applications using React, while also leveraging my experience with designing backend API routes to build full-stack web applications.   

#### Professional Life

I have gotten my first big project recently while I am still studying at Adamson University. I worked as a web developer in a  agency as a web developer to make their first website, along with my friend [SwiftNCloak](https://github.com/SwiftNCloak), who’s a front-end developer.

It was my first project so I've learned a lot, particularly in using a Content Management System like WordPress. And since it is the agency's first website, it needed a custom domain for their email and website, so I've also had an opportunity to learn the things needed for it and I set it up for them as well. Things went good so far,now they have been using the website, as well as their custom domain, and we're also paid well for the job.

#### History

Programming was something I didn’t really knew when I was a kid, although I am very interested in knowing how things work. I remember my dad used to ridicule me because I would disassemble my toys, particularly the ones with intricuit circuitry, to know how how they work, and then later on I’d have a broken toy because I don’t know how to assemble it back.

My journey to becoming a software developer really started when I attended College last year, and learned C# in Sir. Rico’s Computer Programming class. Since then I’ve been working on several side-projects in my free time that made me a better programmer. I’ve really enjoyed the process of figuring out the code, searching the internet and documentation for answers, to make my program work.

#### Outlook

Someone said in every second, a new Javascript framework is born, and I think that is what makes the Javascript ecosystem exciting. Right now I'm focusing on learning the different libraries that React to improve my front-end dev skills. In the following years, I plan to integrate what I learned so far from working professionally and making my side-projects to transition to a full-stack dev.
