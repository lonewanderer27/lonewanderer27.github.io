# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:, but people usually call me "Jay".<br>
I'm mostly a backend developer, and I specialize in making API route endpoints using Flask and Django. I care deeply about building endpoints that are not only fast but also easy to utilize for front-end developers. 

I'm also partly front-end developer, I've made websites using Bootstrap and W3.CSS, and also native applications using PySimpleGUI and .NET Framework.
<br><br>

### Professional Life

I haven't worked professionally, in fact I have only gotten my first big project recently. I am currently working in a security agency as a web developer to make their very first website, along with my friend Mark, who's a front-end developer. 

It was my first project so I am learning a lot, particularly in web-hosting to which I'm thankful for their IT Manager as he taught me things I didn't know about web hosting. Nowadays I am taking the time to learn how a Content Management System like WordPress works, and the syntax of PHP as the client needed an easy way to edit their content without a coder intervention. Things are going smooth so far and we're almost done with the website.

### History

Programming was something I didn't really knew when I was a kid, although I am very interested in knowing how things work. I remember my dad used to ridicule me because I would disassemble my toys, particularly the ones with intricuit circuitry, to know how how they work, and then later on I'd have a broken toy because I don't know how to assemble it back.

My journey to becoming a software developer really started when I attended College last year, and learned C# in Sir. Rico's Computer Programming class. Since then I've been working on several side-projects in my free time that made me a better programmer. I've really enjoyed the process of figuring out the code, searching the internet and documentation for answers, to make my program work.
<br><br>

### Outlook

Right now, I'm very excited to learn Javascript and it's related technologies like React Native. In the following years, I plan to explore the "front-end side" more and become a better-rounded full-stack dev.
