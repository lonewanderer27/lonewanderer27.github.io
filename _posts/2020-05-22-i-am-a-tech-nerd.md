I am a tech-nerd. Collecting a bunch of electronics, opening their insides to see how they work and experimenting with them has been my hobby since I was 11 years old.

Now, it's so much more, I dream the likes of Elon Musk, Bill Gates who own multi-national companies that continues to push the capabilities of our technology, innovating in every where possible.

I also strive to change how the society perceives Programming and Tech related Jobs, you are not just sitting in a chair all day waiting for something to happen.
