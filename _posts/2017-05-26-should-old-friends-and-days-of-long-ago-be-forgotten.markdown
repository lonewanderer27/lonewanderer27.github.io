I think itâ€™s a no. Because these old friends, old memories, they are the reason why and where you are right now. For example, you have an old friend, he/she helped you pass the elementary days, now the time came that you two have to separate of school in High School because of various reasons. You should not forget him/her and what did he/she do to you.
