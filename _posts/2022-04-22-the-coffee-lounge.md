I introduce The Coffee Lounge™

A five-star coffee shop, located in the heart of Metro Manila.

Serving exceptional coffee, partnered with our famous bread products, your experience in The Coffee Lounge will be nothing short of extravagant and relaxing.

It doesn't exist in real world as of now, yet it represents a milestone in my grand scheme plan of things.

10 Years from now, The Coffee Lounge™ is going to be one of the last businesses that I'll establish before going abroad to finally be free from the society that I am currently in, and live my life the way I wanted it to be.

All the hardships that I'm going through right now, countless of sleepless nights, struggles in school, lots of existential crisis, it'll all be worth it in the end.

Thank you so much sa naging graphic designer ng website at UI / UX Engineer ng The Coffee Lounge™ website Tin-Tin Rodriguez. Your works are just amazing, hire niyo na po siya please XD
