First of all, young Jay, your grammar sucks and it's ironic considering that you answered this question during the time that you were taking your Journalism class in Bangkal High School under Prof. Neri

Anyway for it's a no for me. These old friends, together with our old memories with them, they are the reason why and where we are right now. 

So! Story time, I've had an old friend whom helped me pass during my Grade School days. But eventually, there was time that we've had to be separated because my family had to move to another city. We haven't forgotten each other, in fact we often see each other's posts in Facebook because we're friends, but, we do not really interact with each other, we just know what happens. 

Here's the "exciting" part. Campaign period for Philippines 2022 National Elections have officially started, surprise surprise, most of them are Kakampink.

How did I know you ask?

Well Facebook, for some reason, decided that I should see my old friends post again because they are kakampinks. If my memory serves me right, I started to see their post when Pasiglaban (Election Campaign of VP Leni Robredo in Emerald Ave., Pasig City to be President) campaign took place. And since then, I've been interacting with them through comments on their shared post. I could've shared posts too but oh well, I have soooo many BBM supporter relatives so I just didn't.
