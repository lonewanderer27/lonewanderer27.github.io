        I do Programming most of the time but I'm a really random person, why?
      </p>
      <img src="https://previews.123rf.com/images/rastudio/rastudio2003/rastudio200300329/142883983-mobile-application-development-programming-languages-css-html-it-ui-male-programmeer-cartoon-charact.jpg" alt="">
      <figcaption>Credits: https://www.123rf.com/profile_rastudio/</figcaption>
      <p>I study multiple languages at the same time!<br />
      Like right now I'm relearning HTML by coding with Angela <br> in her Udemy Course: Complete Web Development 2021 Bootcamp <br>
      </p>

      <p>And then hours later I'll be programming in Python, <br>
      also with Angela hahaha. You might be already seeing a pattern here <br>
      I loveeee her courses so much because she's not that typical of a teacher. <br>
      She gives lots of exercises after each lesson, and she also shows it in her demos, <br>
      after the lesson so you instantly know DOs and DONTs. <br>
      Plus she's also calm most of the time so that's a plus for me! </p>

      <figcaption>Credits: It's me this time haha! I record the meetings myself using OBS Studio</figcaption>
      <p>
        Combine all of that with my School's own Programming Course <br>
        Because of course I'm a first year College Student at Adamson University. <br>
        That guy in the really blurry picture is my teacher in C# Programming <br>
        Also one of my favorites, he's very slow to explain, really takes the time to make <br>
        his students understand what really is going on in the code. <br>
        AKA "No man left behind", <br>
        and also he's very strict at being honest hahaha
        <h5>should have probably put this in my educational background instead XD</h5>
      </p>
      <img src="images/my-desktop.png" alt="">
      <figcaption>My Xubuntu Desktop</figcaption>
      <p>To top it all off I use Xubuntu, an Ubuntu distro as my main operating system <br>
        <h5>Background:</h5>
        <p>It started out as me trying to make my own Cyanogenmod OS for my tablet back <br>
          Because the maintainer that we had at that time just didn't wanted to continue <br>
          it anymore as he's going to be busy in some school stuff instead. <br>
          So I installed Ubuntu and oh boy it was a wild ride, I was a beginner and I <br>
          didn't had an experience in installing another OS, dual booting, how to use <br>
          the terminal, how Linux file naming works etc... All that while trying to <br>
          do something, which is to compile an OS from scratch.  <br> <br>
          Needless to say it didn't turned out so well, I just gave up after two weeks <br>
          of trying to learn it but since then I have stuck to using Linux.
        </p>

        <figcaption>Credits: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Mint</figcaption>
        <p>
          I have since then moved to Linux Mint cause they said that it's the best Linux <br>
          distro for beginners.
        </p>
        <img src="https://www.minitool.com/images/uploads/lib/2020/10/zorin-os/zorin-os-1.jpg" alt="">
        <figcaption>https://www.minitool.com/lib/zorin-os.html</figcaption>
        <p>And then Zorin OS because it looked like a hybird MacOS and Windows, and it <br>
        functions pretty much like Windows so I liked it.
        </p>
        <img src="https://fossbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Manjaro-Linux-20.0-%E2%80%9CLysia%E2%80%9D-Released-A-Beginner-Friendly-Arch-Experience-768x440.jpg.webp" alt="">
        <figcaption>Credits: https://fossbytes.com/manjaro-linux-20-0-lysia-download-features/</figcaption>
        <p>
          Then I thought to spice things up so I tried Manjaro. <br>
          It was a great experience, even though it broke a couple of times, <br>
          I have learned a lot on how to diagnose a Linux sytem <br>
          and I also admire how Pacman is incredibly faster than APT on Ubuntu.
        </p>

        <figcaption>Credits: https://analyticsindiamag.com/10-most-stable-linux-distros-in-2021/</figcaption>
        <p>
          And many many more distros that I just used for maybe two days then moved on <br>
          to the next, typical thing that a new Linux user would do.
        </p>
        <img src="images/my-desktop-2" alt="">
        <p>But in the end I just stuck with Xubuntu, I have been running this distro for a year now. <br>
          It's got everything that I need; beginner friendly distro and snappy XFCE DE. <br>
        </p>
        <h5>Sorry, my background was waaaaaayyy too long hahaha</h5>
